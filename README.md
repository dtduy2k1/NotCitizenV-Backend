# NotCitizenV-Backend WIP
I tried to develop a backend in SpringBoot in 2 weeks during Lunar New Year vacation while my friends go everywhere.<br>
I struggled and lost my last hope when implementing SpringBoot Security to this.<br>
Row filtering, Authentication, Authorization, etc... I wanna study more.<br>
Idea from https://itest.com.vn/lects/webappdev/mockproj/citizenv.htm, except district and ward codes are different.<br>
